                HTCONDOR'S CVSTRAC FORK

.................................................................
SUMMARY

Just run "make" at the top level.  After a while you should end
up with a binary in build/gittrac suitable for use.

SUMMARY
OVERVIEW

This is a fork of CVSTrac
http://www.cvstrac.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.html .
We've modified it to support a variety of local features,
including, but not limited to:

- Private tickets
- Relabelling/reusing some fields associated with tickets
- Private wiki pages
- Some general UI tweaks.

It's based on CVSTrac d78282a902cc0cdf92a789215be12d1a7024b3ea
2008-11-27 17:49:26 with changes entirely by tannenba.

Since we forked, CVSTrac's public CVS repository was taken down,
replaced with a Fossil repository.  http://fossil-scm.org Fossil
is a revision control system created by the author of CVSTrac and
SQLite.  It's designed to be a lightweight distributed revision
control system with integrated Wiki and ticket tracking system.
You probably won't need it unless you there are upstream CVSTrac
changes you want.  You probably won't need to get changes, sinec
CVSTrac is basically dead.  It's been replaced with Fossil.

BRANCHES

master   - Our work

official - The upstream source. Includes at least one set of
		   changes that have happened since we forked and are not
		   included in our builds.  Includes
		   cvstrac/cvstrac.fossil, allowing access to the old
		   revisions and potentially simplifying pulling down new
		   revisions.


.................................................................
DIRECTORIES

cvstrac   - The version of CVSTrac being used.
			http://www.cvstrac.org

sqlite    - The version of SQLite being used.
			https://www.sqlite.org/

build     - Where output is placed, including the final binary
            build/gittrac

data      - Data files for testing.
	        cp -r /p/condor/gittrac-backups/data ./

UPDATING 

CVSTrac

	cd cvstrac
	git checkout official
	fossil pull
	git status
	git add <new files>
	git commit -a
	git checkout master
	git merge official
	make clean
	make

You will need fossil http://fossil-scm.org 

This complexity is done so we have a "clean" official branch for
reference work.  Note that as of Oct 11, 2012, there is work on
the official branch that is not on our master branch!


SQLite

	Find the latest sqlite-autoconf-*.tar.gz from
	https://www.sqlite.org/download.html

	wget https://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-autoconf-VERSION-GOES-HERE.tar.gz
	tar xvzf sqlite-autoconf-*.tar.gz
	mv sqlite sqlite-old
	mv sqlite-autoconf-<version> sqlite
	git status
	git add <new files>
	git commit -a
	make clean
	make

You'll probably want to do this on both master and official,
perhaps merging from official to master.  It's not a big deal,
since we haven't forked SQLite, nor do we anticipate doing so.


.................................................................
TESTING

	cp -r /p/condor/gittrac-backups/data ./
	make run
	firefox http://localhost:8080

Note that "make run" blocks until you kill the process (which
shuts down the server).
